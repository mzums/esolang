# Gardeners' Script

Gardeners' Script is an esoteric programming language (esolang) that uses gardening metaphors as its core programming paradigm. Variables become plots, operations become gardening tasks, and program flow mimics the seasonal cycles of a garden.

## Key Features
- **Gardening Metaphors**: All programming concepts map to gardening activities
- **Plot-based Variables**: Store values in named garden plots
- **Greenhouse Stack**: Temporary storage for plot values
- **Harvest Output**: Collect program output through harvest commands
- **Seasonal Loops**: `bloom` and `wither` commands for loop control
